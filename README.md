## Overview

GITHUBIFY is a tool designed to help developers quickly understand complex codebases. With features like AI-powered chat, real-time collaboration, and video calls, it streamlines onboarding and boosts productivity.

- Chat with our bot to understand complex codebases and get a better understanding of the codebase.
- Reduces the time taken to understand codebases by 50% and increases productivity by 2x.
- Plus, senior developers can focus on more important tasks rather than explaining the codebase to the newbies.
- The bot uses Langchain API to understand the codebase, vectorize it, and then uses OpenAI API to generate responses to the user's queries.
- The bot also has a chat with fellow contributors and a video call feature.
